GCC for TI
for the Texas TI99/4a 
(http://atariage.com/forums/topic/164295-gcc-for-the-ti/page-6),

1. download and decompress gcc-installer.tar.gz from http://atariage.com/forums/topic/164295-gcc-for-the-ti/page-1
2. install libgmp-dev libmpfr-dev tree
3. set export MAKEINFO=missing (to fix one error about texinfo)
4. run the "install.sh" script
5. find files inside <target dir>/bin

XTC68 (C68) 
for the Motorola 68008-based Sinclair QL 
(https://github.com/stronnag/xtc68)

1. set up a 32-bit dev environment, e.g., "sudo apt install libc6-dev-i386"
2. clone the repository
3. download the disk1 http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/c/424frun1.zip from http://www.dilwyn.me.uk/c/index.html and put it inside the "support" directory
4. run "make all"
5. run the "install.sh" script


Z8KGCC 
for the Zilog Z8000-based Olivetti M20 series 
(http://www.z80ne.com/m20/sections/download/z8kgcc/z8kgcc.html),

1. download and use the pre-compiled compiler for Linux from http://www.z80ne.com/m20/index.php.
2. in order to insert the binary inside a disk image download the tool m20floppy from  ftp://ftp.groessler.org/…/ol…/imgtools/m20floppy-0.61.tar.gz
3. use a bootable image from https://github.com/…/m…/tools/olivetti_m20/pcos20h_empty.img
4. to compile and link use the qcc command:
- to produce an object file do something like : qcc -c hello.c -o hello.o
- to link and produce a binary "a_out" do something like qcc crt.o part1.o part2.o
Remark:
After linking and compilation the command will give us the number of bytes used for the "dataspace".
5. in order to use the binary inside an emulator we need to add some meta-data and choose an emulator, e.g.,
QPC from https://www.kilgus.net/qpc/ :
- run the following commands
"
f$=“dos1_<path to binary in C: where you use '_' instead of '/'>“
l=FLEN(\f$)
mem=RESPR(l)
LBYTES f$,mem
SEXEC ram1_<name in QL>,mem,l,<value >= dataspace bytes>
"
- you will have the program in ram1 with the name chosen by the SEXEC command, which you run by selecting ram1 and the program.


GCC for Atari ST
