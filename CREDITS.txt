CREDITS

I have helped by some people.

This is just a partial list.

Stefano Bodrato: lots of help on all Z80 targets including development on the Z88Dk to support my game.

Simon Jonassen: Help on getting a good routine for the keyboard input for all CoCo and Dragon models.

Christian Groessler: has helped me to improve the Makefile and fix an issue on the Atari 8-bit color version.
