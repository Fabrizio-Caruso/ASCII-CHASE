BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

The game is compiled through different C cross-compilers (currently CC65's compiler and Z88DK's compilers). 

The different versions are produced thanks to the cross-compilers and parameters pased to these compilers
through the -D option.

PARAMETERS

General parameters:

- FULL_GAME [all systems]
If this parameter is passed to the compiler, then the full-fledged version of the game (different levels and enemies)
will be generated. Otherwise the "minimal" version (all levels look like the first one) will be generated.

- REDEFINED_CHARS [some systems]
This parameter activates redefined characters including the "animation" of the player's characters

- SOUNDS [some systems]
This parameter activates in-game sounds.

It toggles 5-color 20x24 text mode for ATARI and ATARIXL.
