BBCIM

DESCRIPTION
bbcim is a file conversion utility to help in transferring files and for use with emulators (Acorn DFS diskimage manipulation and more)

USE
bbcim  option [file [{filelist}]]  (any extension is allowed for diskimages)

options:
\-e[s|d,#,b,r] [diskoptions] diskimage [adfs_dir] [{list}]

extracts files.
Without the d or s or # the option -e extracts files from a diskimage with filenames like 'imagefile.$.!BOOT'. With every 'bare' file an info file is created containing load- and execution addresses (archive format).

d
extracts the files in a directory named after the diskimage: eg. 'imagefile/$.ELITE'.

s
gives short filenames (no leading diskimage name).

#
removes the bbc root directory $ and glues other directories to the filename. (name clash is possible but unlikely, eg. E.E and EE, in that case you will be asked whether to rename, overwrite, etc.). Note that I've chosen # instead of $ as this is used as a wildcard character in unix.

b
with this option -e only produces the bare files, and no info files.

r
removes the diskimage after extracting files.

In all cases a catalogue file 'imagefile.cat' is made except when a list of file names is given, in which case:
 - only the files in the list are extracted from the disk image
 -  r is ignored
 -  a catalogue is not produced.

Diskoptions are: [-DFS|W62|DDOS|ADFS|HDFS] [-SS|DS]

 -c [diskoptions]  disk [adfs_dir]
show catalogue (files in image).

\-40  disk
expand a diskimage to 40 tracks.

\-80  disk
expand a diskimage to 80 tracks.

\-max disk
expand diskimage to (almost) 256 K.

\-min disk
minimize diskimage (equal to *COMPACT and cutting off after last used sector).

\-crc [diskoptions] disk [adfs_dir]
calculates crc's for all the files in the diskimage.

\-new [diskoptions] disk
makes a new (empty) diskimage (512 bytes, bootoption EXEC).
OBSOLETE (-a creates a new diskimage if needed).

\-a[b,r] [diskoptions] diskimage [adfs_dir] {list}
add files (in archive format) to the diskimage:
Automatically skips '.inf' files so bbcim -a disk.bbc * (unix) gives no problems. If the diskimage didn't exist a new one will be created. The option 'r' removes the archive files after adding them to the diskimage. the option 'b'
.I adds files without .inf file (setting load/exec addresses to 0).

\-d [diskoptions] diskimage [adfs_dir] {list}
delete the list of files from the diskimage.
NOTE: files without a bbcdir are assumed to have the root dir, eg. ELITE is assumed to be $.ELITE

\-boot diskimage bootoption
Sets the bootoption of the diskimage.

\-interss sd|dd file0 file1 file2
interleaves single sided diskimages file0 and file1 to file2.

\-splitds sd|dd file.2
splits interleaved diskimage file.2 to file.0 & file.1

\-ddos2dfs file.dd
splits a single sided DDOS diskdump into several DFS diskimages.
Eg. myfiles.dd > myfilesA.bbc,..., myfilesH.bbc.

\-w62dfs file[.ext]
splits a single sided watford 62 file diskimage into 2 DFS diskimages (one image if there are less than 32 files on the image) file.w1 & file.w2.

\-x {list}
xbeeb conversion of archive files in the list.

\-s[#] file
splits a text file with file information into .inf files. Lines not starting with a bbc (DFS) file name (i.e. dir.name) are skipped. The option # removes the DFS directory $ and glues others to the file name. THIS CAN BE USED TO MAKE ARCHIVE FILES FROM AN XBEEB DIRECTORY (or any other text file).

\-y {list}
renames archive/info files to standard format (as produced with # in -e), add's crc's if not found, checks crc's if found.

\-icrc {list}
check crc's of given archive files.

\-xcrc
guess.

\-V
print version no.

\-H
help (command overview).


NOTES
1. options and files can be entered after starting the programs for all options that do not require a file list.

2. for option -d and -e with a list:
  2.1 wildcards are not possible
  2.2 names are case sensitive.

3. (see also 2) several files in a diskimage can have the same name when using -a (actually useful to get things back to a beeb, no need to rename).
