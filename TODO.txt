TODO

(0) Ghost killed on the gun in boss level?

(1) Decide what to do with  
I. ghost vs ghost collision 
II. player vs dead ghost
II. dead ghost image

(2) Better space ghosts

(3) Implement sameLocationAtAnyLocation (rename it) to save space

(4) Save memory by placing sleep outside print text

(5) Optimize power up code (all power-ups can share the handling code)

(6) Optimize text code: printCenteredAtRow

(7) Remove useless draw bombs in level

(8) Optimize draw border code (draw horizontal and draw vertical)

(9) Optimize constant artihmetic (place constants before and simplify expressions)

(10) Change long with int + trailing zero (divide points by 10)
