IMHO the best solution for this is to move the active video bank to $c000 ($dd00=0)... 
then you can use $c000 for screen data, and the complete rest of the bank, 
minus $d000-$e000, for sprites.

so... poke56576,0:poke53272,2: ... that will put the screen to $c000 (49152) and 
the charset will be fetched from $c800 (51200) 
(you can copy the original charset there, or use the opportunity and use a custom one). 
then there will be space for sprites from $c400-$c800 and from $e000-$ffff.

one thing i dont remember though, you have to tell the basic where the screen is located now 
(else it will still print to 1024...). 
a quick look at aay64 says the highbyte of the screen memory location should be written to $0288 ... 
so poke 648,192 should do the trick.

1. Compile with sccz80 and the classic C library. This is equivalent to pre-1.99A.
2. Compile with sccz80 and the new C library. Compile lines include "-clib=new".
3. Compile with sdcc and the new C library. Compile lines include "-clib=sdcc_ix" or "-clib=sdcc_iy".

The parameters are pushed left to right as dom mentioned and followed by a call to the asm subroutine.  This means the asm subroutine sees a stack frame containg pushed parameters followed by a return address.  It is usually (but not always) faster to access the parameters by popping them off the stack.  So for example:

int myfunc(int a, int b)
{
   #asm
   pop bc   ; bc = ret address
   pop hl   ; hl = int b
   pop de  ; de = int a

   push de    ; now restore stack
   push hl
   push bc

   ; do stuff with return value left in hl

   #endasm
}  // ret automatically inserted by C compiler at end brace

The push / pops require 63 cycles to get all the parameters into the registers.  Other methods would take longer.


The standard C calling convention has the caller responsible for creating the stack frame and removing the stack frame following the call to the subroutine.  This is why you see the asm function above restoring the stack after popping the parameters -- the stack must be left unchanged for the caller to restore it on return.

You can specify an asm function to be callee-linked, meaning the subroutine is responsible for clearing the stack frame from the stack.  Then the above would be written as:

int __CALLEE__ myfunc(int a, int b)
{
   #asm
   pop bc   ; bc = ret address
   pop hl   ; hl = int b
   pop de  ; de = int a
   push bc  ; put the return address back

   ; do stuff with return value left in hl

   #endasm
}  // ret automatically inserted by C compiler at end brace

Now the asm function has removed the parameters from the stack frame and has left the return address for safe ret at the end of the subroutine.  All asm subroutines should use CALLEE linkage as there is almost never a reason not to use it.


One last linkage is FASTCALL where a single parameter can be passed by the compiler in the HL register pair.

int __FASTCALL__ myfunc(int a)
{
   #asm
   ; hl = int a
   ; return address on stack

   ; do stuff with return value left in hl
   #endasm
}  // ret automatically inserted by C compiler at end brace
