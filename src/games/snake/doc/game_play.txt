

GAME PLAY:

The game concept is inspired by Nibbler (arcade game by Rock-Ola) and Snake (arcade and cell phone game).

1. GOAL
Eat all apples on each level while avoiding being killed by:
- biting yourself
- consuming all energy (if you do not eat apples for too long)
- bumping into mines

2. SUB-GOALS
- Collect the rings for points
- Collect 3 rings on the same level without being killed, you may unlock a secret item
- Unlock the secret level (Hint: keeping on collecting rings...)

3. ENERGY
You start with maximum energy and a slow snake. 
If you do not eat apples, the snake starts moving faster. 
Once the snake has reached maximum speed, its energy starts decreasing.
Hint: Keep an eye on the energy before you decide to go collect bonus items instead of apples.

4. COLLECTABLE ITEMS
- Apple: slows you down and avoids energy from decreasing;
- Ring: bonus points + secrets unlocked if you collect many;
- $: extra points;
- Freeze: freeze mine and restore energy;
- Extra life: secret extra life item.
IMPORTANT: eating items (usually) makes your snake grow, which may make your life harder.

5. ENEMIES
The mines are your enemy. They can be both fixed or moving.
Moving mines bounce any time that bump into anything.
If the snake's HEAD touches the mine, the snake dies instantly.
The body of the snake CAN touch the mines. The snake's body CAN be used as a shield against mines.
Hint: collecting several rings may help you against the mines.

6. WALLS
Hitting against walls or magic walls (walls that constantly disappear and reappear) pauses the snake and the game.
This gives you the time to think about your next move. Your snake does NOT starve while paused on a wall.

7. LEVELS
The game has 32 normal levels + 1 secret level. The game has an end.
There are 17 different maps. Normal levels use 16 different maps. The secret level has its own map.
Levels 17-32 use the same maps as levels 1-16 but have more mines and apples to collect.
Completing a level gives you a bonus that depends on:
- snake length
- energy left
- number of rings collected
- level

8. SCORE

- time         :   1 point (score slowly increases by 1 point)
- $            :   5 points
- Apple        :  20 points
- first ring   :  10 points
- second ring  :  20 points
- third ring   :  40 points
- freeze       :  50 points
- fourth ring  :  80 points
- fifth ring   : 160 points
- level bonus  : (snake length X 2) + (energy X 8) + (32 X rings) + (level X 4) 


9. EXTRA LIVES
Every 5000 points you are awarded an extra life.
Hint: Collecting the rings and keeping maximum energy is a good strategy to maximize your score.
